# CTF-Lang

> Programming

Author: @alexandre-lavoie

## Overview

Esoteric Programming Languages (Esolangs) are programming languages that are designed to be weird, hard, and/or a joke. Often included in CTFs are `BrainFuck` and `JSFuck`. To introduce more challenge, a custom esolang `CTF-Lang` was created for this CTF.

## Specification

A `SPECIFICATION.md` is provided to describe `CTF-Lang`. The interpreters were designed around this document. 

## Challenges

Given the scale of the repo, challenges were split off into `./challenges`. The challenges should be prefaced by this overview, provide the specification document, and a link to the website.
